        As used in this Privacy Policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information
        include, among other things, using cookies on a computer, subjecting the

        <br />
        <br />
        1. WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?
        <br />
        <br />
        Personal Information - In General.
        <br />
        <br />
        This Privacy Policy covers how we use and disclose personally identifiable
        information that we gather from the time that you initially access our Sites or
        use our Services. Personally identifiable information refers to any information
        about you that can be used to contact or identify you, and information on your use
        or potential use of the Sites or our Services (collectively, "Personal
        Information"). This policy does not apply to the practices of companies and / or
        Sites that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or
        manage.
        <br />
        <br />
        Protected Health Information.
        <br />
        <br />
        We are dedicated to maintaining the privacy and integrity of your protected health
        information ("PHI"). PHI is Personal (individually identifiable) Information about
        you that relates to (a) your past, present, or future physical or mental health or
        condition, (b) the provision of health care to you, or (c) your past, present, or
        future payment for the provision of health care, which is created, received,
        transmitted, or maintained by the Company. This Privacy Policy describes how we
        protect your privacy as a visitor to, or general user of our Sites and Services.
        You have additional rights under federal and state law with respect to the access
        to, use, and disclosure of Personal Information that constitutes PHI. For a more
        complete description of your rights with respect to PHI, please refer to our HIPAA
        Notice, which provides important information to you about how we may use and
        disclose your PHI.
        <br />
        <br />
        2. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
        <br />
        <br />
        We collect personal information you choose to provide, e.g., through
        registrations, applications, use of the Services, surveys, and in connection with
        your inquiries, from the time that you initially access our Sites or use our
        Services. The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and
        improve our Services.
        <br />
        <br />
        From time to time, we may use or augment the personal information we have about
        you with information obtained from third parties. For example, we may use such
        third party information to confirm contact or financial information, to verify
        eligibility, or to better understand your interests by associating demographic
        information with the information you have provided.
        <br />
        <br />
        We collect the following types of information from our customers:
        <br />
        <br />
        Personal Information You Provide to Us.
        <br />
        <br />
        We receive and store any information you enter on our Sites or provide to us in
        several ways. Personal Information that we collect may include things like your
        full name, mobile phone number, credit card and/or other payment information (if
        applicable - i.e., self-pay participants), your email address and the email
        address of your contacts, home and business postal addresses, IP address, browser
        information, username, password, certain health information (e.g., weight,
        insurance information), and any other information or data that you provide when
        using our Sites and/or our Services. You can choose not to provide us with certain
        information, but that may result in our inability to provide you access to many of
        our special features. Reclaim's goal is to use the Personal Information you
        provide for such purposes as answering questions and communicating with you about
        the Company's products and services, including updates and new features.
        <br />
        <br />
        PLEASE NOTE: By using the Services, you consent to and authorize Reclaim to
        disclose your eligibility for and participation in the Services (i.e., you meet
        the clinical enrollment criteria for the Services which identify those individuals
        at risk for certain chronic diseases and have elected at your own discretion to
        participate in the same) to the other users of the Sites and Services. The users,
        including but not limited to Site administrators, Health Coaches, and your fellow
        support group members will have access to a range of Personal Information such as
        your name and picture, linking you to your diagnosis and reason for program
        participation. Specifically, as we group participants based on certain
        characteristics, fellow support group members may be co-workers or other
        acquaintances.
        <br />
        <br />
        We take great efforts in protecting your privacy, however, we cannot control, and
        expressly disclaim any responsibility for, whether or how users will subsequently
        use or disclose posted or previously disclosed information. If you do not consent
        to the disclosure of this information, you should not access or use the Sites or
        the Services. The Services include the ability for users to share Personal
        Information, including information regarding your medical condition. Any
        information you choose to provide or upload to the group Sites, including Personal
        Information about your medical condition, will be visible to your group, as well
        as Health Coaches, Site administrators, and other Site users. As your information
        will be viewable to the other users of the Sites, you should provide only the
        information you feel comfortable disclosing. There may be an opportunity to speak
        on the phone or via video chat in a group conference call. Participation in such
        opportunities is not mandatory, but should you choose to participate, you should
        share only as much information as you feel comfortable sharing in these additional
        forums.
        <br />
        <br />
        Personal Information Collected Automatically.
        <br />
        <br />
        We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our
        Sites and / or use our Services. We automatically receive and record information
        on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, and the page you
        requested. In addition, we may use personal identifiers to recognize you when you
        arrive at the Site via an external link, e.g., such as a link appearing on a third
        party site or in a Reclaim-generated email presented to you. See also our What
        About Cookies? section below. We will also use your information to provide
        customer service and support.
        <br />
        <br />
        Generally, our Services automatically collect usage information, such as the
        numbers and frequency of visitors to our Sites and its components, similar to TV
        ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. We only use this
        data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner
        that would permit us to identify you personally ("De-identified Information").
        This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users or customers
        use parts of the Sites or Services so that we can make the Sites and Services as
        appealing to as many users and customers as possible and improve our Services. We
        may provide this de-identified, aggregate data to our partners to identify how our
        customers, collectively, use our Sites or Services. Again, we never disclose
        aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.
        <br />
        <br />
        You may set your browser to refuse or disable these data collection methods, but
        doing so may change your experience with the Sites or the Services, diminish
        certain aspects of the Sites' functionality or render certain features of the
        Sites or the Services inoperable. The Sites may not recognize or respond to "do
        not track" technologies employed by your browser.
        <br />
        <br />
        E-mail Communications.
        <br />
        <br />
        We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from us if your computer
        supports this type of program. We use this confirmation to help us make emails
        more interesting and helpful. We also compare our customer list to lists received
        from other companies in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our
        customers. When you receive e-mail from us, you can opt out of receiving further
        e-mails by following the included instructions to unsubscribe. However, by opting
        out of further email communications after you enroll in the Services, you may
        limit program reminders and other valuable program content and components.
        <br />
        <br />
        What About Cookies?
        <br />
        <br />
        Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard
        drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and
        tell us how and when pages in our Sites are visited and by how many people. We use
        cookies to enhance visitors' experiences by understanding how visitors and / or
        users engage with and navigate our Sites.
        <br />
        <br />
        Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will
        prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the
        sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of
        each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the
        cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some
        of our Sites' most attractive features. If your browser is set to reject cookies,
        websites that are cookie-enabled will not recognize you when you return to the
        website, and some website functionality may be lost.
        <br />
        <br />
        We may serve ads on the Sites. These ads may be delivered to users by our
        advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to
        recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile
        information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad
        networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe
        will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy refers only to the use of
        cookies by the Company and does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties
        (e.g., advertisers).
        <br />
        <br />
        3. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE SHARE?
        <br />
        <br />
        Personal Information regarding our users is an integral part of our business. We
        will not rent, sell or share your Personal Information with other people or
        non-affiliated companies except to provide the Services, when we otherwise have
        your permission, or under the following circumstances:
        <br />
        <br />
        Forums: We may make available your Personal Information through the Sites and/or
        the Services (for example, discussion boards, chat rooms, profile pages, bulletin
        boards, blogs, instant messaging, activities, polls, games and other communication
        forums) (each, a "Forum") to which you post information and materials. Some of
        these Forums are described more specifically below. Please note that any
        information, text, and images posted or disclosed by the user on or through such
        Forums may be visible to the user's group(s), as well as Health Coaches, Site
        administrators, visitors to the Sites, and other users of the Sites. Specifically,
        Personal Information such as the picture you've uploaded and your screen name, may
        be available for other users to view when you make a posting to such Forums.
        Information regarding your activities in such Services may also be available for
        view by other users (for example, other users may be able to view a list of all
        postings you have made in all available Forums). Any postings you have made to a
        Forum may also be available for view later by users of the Sites by scrolling to
        older posts on the Forum. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when
        deciding to disclose your Personal Information, such as your illness, or any other
        information, through a Forum or otherwise through the Site.
        <br />
        <br />
        Discussion Boards and Chat Rooms: We may provide functionality to post on our
        discussion boards, and permit you to enter into chat rooms and communicate with
        other users in the chat rooms. Please note that if you use such functionalities to
        communicate, your name / screen name will be disclosed to all visitors to the
        discussion boards, present and future, as well as all users in the chat room at
        that time. Please remember that information posted to discussion boards becomes
        public information. Use caution when posting. Further, if a comment you make on
        the discussion board or in the chat room contains Personal Information, we cannot
        control how the Personal Information will be used or disclosed by the other users
        of the discussion board or chat room. We urge you to exercise discretion and
        caution when deciding to disclose your Personal Information, or any other
        information, in any comment and/or message, and to be careful about the people to
        whom you send such comments and/or messages.
        <br />
        <br />
        Messaging Services: We may provide functionality to permit you to send messages,
        including instant messages, to other users through the Sites. Please note that if
        you use such functionality to send such a message to another user, your screen
        name will be disclosed to that user, as well as Site administrators. Further, if a
        message you send using such functionality contains Personal Information, we cannot
        control how the Personal Information will be used or disclosed by the recipient of
        your message. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to
        disclose your Personal Information, or any other information, in any message, and
        to be careful about the people to whom you send such messages.
        <br />
        <br />
        IN THE CASE OF YOUR USE OF FORUMS, DISCUSSION BOARDS, CHAT ROOMS AND MESSAGING
        SERVICES, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF ANY
        INFORMATION, INCLUDING PERSONAL INFORMATION, THAT IS DISCLOSED BY YOU OR ON YOUR
        BEHALF BY YOUR SYSTEM IN SUCH FORUMS, DISCUSSION BOARDS, CHAT ROOMS AND MESSAGING
        SERVICES. BY DISCLOSING ANY OF YOUR INFORMATION VIA FORUMS, DISCUSSION BOARDS,
        CHAT ROOMS AND MESSAGING SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPT ANY RISK AND DAMAGE
        ARISING FROM DISCLOSURE OF SUCH INFORMATION.
        <br />
        <br />
        User Profiles: We may provide functionality to permit you to create a user profile
        page in which you may provide information about yourself, including, without
        limitation, your illness, symptoms, treatments, as well as your feelings about
        your illness and/or yourself ("User Submissions," as further defined in our
        Terms). You may also be able to upload pictures, videos and stories to your
        profile page as part of the User Submissions. User Submissions may be displayed to
        other users (including members of your group(s), who may be from the same
        deployment or otherwise affiliated) to facilitate user interaction within the
        Sites. Email addresses are used to add new User Submissions to user profiles and
        to communicate through User Submissions. Users' email addresses will not be
        directly revealed to other users by us, except when the user is "connected" to
        another user via a shared group membership, or an invitation, or if the user has
        chosen to include their email address in their User Profile. Please note that any
        User Submissions you make, including Personal Information, on or through your
        profile page may be available for other users, the Company, administration,
        moderators, and other staff. Additionally, other users may be able to post
        comments and view posted comments on your profile page.
        <br />
        <br />
        Communication in Response to User Submissions: As part of the Sites and Services,
        you will receive from us email and other communication relating to your User
        Submissions. You acknowledge and agree that by posting such User Submissions, we
        may send you email and other communication (e.g., phone or text message) that we
        determine, in our sole discretion, as related to your User Submissions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: In order to provide you with the optimal
        user experience, we anticipate that we may become affiliated and work closely with
        a variety of third party businesses. In certain situations, these businesses may
        sell products or services to you through the Sites. In other situations, we may
        provide services, or sell products, jointly with affiliated businesses. You should
        be able to recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your
        transactions, and throughout the course of the transactions, we will share your
        Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that affiliated
        business.
        <br />
        <br />
        Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and
        need to share your information with them to provide products and/or services to
        you. Without specific authorization and/or consent, we limit the rights of our
        agents to use Personal Information we share with them to that which is minimally
        necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information
        for the above purposes.
        <br />
        <br />
        Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these
        types of transactions, customer information, including Personal Information about
        customers, is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover,
        if the Company, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the
        unlikely event that the Company goes out of business or enters bankruptcy,
        Personal Information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by
        a third party. By continuing to use our Sites and Services, you acknowledge that
        if we sell or transfer our business (e.g., through an acquisition) or an asset
        (e.g., our website) to another company, we will share your personal information
        with such company and will require such company to use and protect your personal
        information consistent with this Privacy Policy.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sponsors and Third Party Administrators, As Required by Law: In limited
        circumstances, we may disclose certain of your Personal Information (e.g., reports
        containing data related to enrollment, engagement, retention, and outcomes) to
        your sponsor or your sponsor's third party administrators (e.g., incentives
        vendors, wellness administrators, etc.) for treatment, payment, or healthcare
        operations purposes and for other purposes permitted or required by law, as more
        fully described in our HIPAA Notice.
        <br />
        <br />
        Protection of the Company and Others: We may release Personal Information when we
        believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or
        apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property,
        or safety of the Company, our employees, our users, or others. This includes
        exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud
        protection, detection or suppression, and credit risk reduction. If necessary, we
        will make all legally required disclosures of any breach of the security,
        confidentiality, or integrity of your Personal Information, including, without
        limitation, breaches of your unencrypted, electronically stored, "personal
        information" or "medical information" (as defined in applicable state statutes on
        security breach notification). To the extent permitted by applicable laws, we will
        make such disclosures to you via email or conspicuous posting on your private
        profile on the Sites in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable
        delay, insofar as consistent with (a) the legitimate needs of law enforcement, or
        (b) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the
        reasonable integrity of the data system.
        <br />
        <br />
        With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your
        Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to control
        the sharing of this information.
        <br />
        <br />
        De-identified Information: We may create De-identified Information from the
        information that you share with us and use such De-identified Information without
        restriction. We may, for instance, share De-identified Information with the
        sponsors paying for your participation in the Services (e.g., reports containing
        data related to enrollment, engagement, retention, and outcomes to evidence
        overall program success metrics), and with third party administrators working with
        the sponsors to administer certain services to you (e.g., incentives vendors,
        wellness administrators, etc.). Again, we never disclose aggregate information in
        a manner that would identify you personally.
        <br />
        <br />
        4. IS MY PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE?
        <br />
        <br />
        We employ industry standard administrative, physical, and technical measures
        designed to safeguard and protect information under our control from unauthorized
        access, use, and disclosure. In addition, when we collect, maintain, access, use,
        or disclose your Personal Information, we will do so using systems and processes
        consistent with information privacy and security requirements under applicable
        federal and state laws, including, without limitation, the Health Insurance
        Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA").
        <br />
        <br />
        Furthermore, your individual user account is protected by a password for your
        privacy and security. To ensure that there is no unauthorized access to your
        account and Personal Information, we suggest that you safeguard your password
        appropriately and limit access to your computer and browser by signing off after
        you have finished accessing your account.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Sites contain links to third party websites ("Third Party Sites"). In such an
        event, before using the Third Party Sites or related services, you must review and
        accept the terms of use and privacy policies for those sites and/or services. We
        are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of any Third Party
        Sites, and we are not responsible or liable for the availability, reliability,
        content, functions, performance, accuracy, legality, appropriateness, services,
        materials, or any other aspect of such Third Party Sites. This Privacy Policy only
        governs information collected on our Sites or through our Services. When you
        access any Third Party Sites, you do so at your own risk, and you understand and
        agree that you are solely responsible for reading and understanding any terms of
        use and/or privacy policies that apply to such Third Party Sites.
        <br />
        <br />
        We exercise great care to protect your personal information. However, we cannot
        ensure or warrant the security and confidentiality of any information that you
        transmit to us or receive from us via the Services offered through our Sites, by
        Internet or email, or the appropriateness of the measures we use to safeguard such
        information. Unauthorized entry, access, or use; loss; hardware or software
        failure; and other factors, may compromise the security of your information at any
        time. This is especially true for any information that you transmit to us via
        email or text message since we have no way of protecting that information until it
        reaches us since email and text message and the communication lines they travel
        over do not have the security features that are built into our Sites and may not
        be secure. If you have reason to believe that your data or your interactions with
        us are no longer secure, you may contact us at the email address, mailing address
        or telephone number listed at the end of this Privacy Policy. In addition, if you
        have privacy or data security related questions, please feel free to contact the
        office identified at the end of this Privacy Policy.

        6. WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE REGARDING MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?
        <br />
        <br />
        As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose information, even though
        it may be needed to take advantage of certain features of the Sites and the
        Services.
        <br />
        <br />
        You are able to add or update certain information on pages, such as those listed
        in the "What Personal Information Can I Access And Correct" section, above. When
        you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised
        information in our records.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you would like us to remove your records from our system, you may request
        deletion of your account with us by sending e-mail to support@reclaim.com. Please
        note that some information may remain in our records after deletion of your
        account, including any information or records we are legally obligated to retain.
        We will process your request within a reasonable time, but please note that you
        may receive additional offers as we process your request.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you do not wish to receive email or other mail, phone calls or texts from us,
        please click on the "Unsubscribe" link contained in the emails or indicate this
        preference by emailing us at support@reclaim.com. Please note that if you do not
        want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal
        notices will still govern your use of the Sites, and you are responsible for
        reviewing such legal notices for changes. We will process your request within a
        reasonable time, but please note that you may receive additional emails as we
        process your request.

        7. HOW DO WE PROTECT CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION?
        <br />
        <br />
        The Services are not directed to children. We do not knowingly allow or solicit
        anyone under the age of 18 to participate independently in any of the Services. We
        do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children. If a parent or
        guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal
        Information, please contact us. If we become aware that a user of the Services is
        under the age of 18 and has provided us with Personal Information without
        verifiable parental consent, we will delete such Personal Information from our
        files.
        <br />
        <br />
        8. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
        <br />
        <br />
        By using the Sites and Services, you agree to the current Privacy Policy and our
        Terms, into which this Privacy Policy is incorporated. We reserve the right, in
        our sole discretion, to modify, discontinue, or terminate the Services or to
        modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Use of information we collect now is
        subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used or
        disclosed. If we make changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will
        notify you by posting an announcement on our Sites and/or sending you an email. By
        continuing to access or use the Services after we have posted a modification or
        have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree
        to be bound by the modified Privacy Policy. If the modified Privacy Policy is not
        acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease accessing the Sites and / or
        using the Services.
